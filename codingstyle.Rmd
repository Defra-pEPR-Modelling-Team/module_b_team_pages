title: "Coding Style"
---

Generally we use the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) to ensure our code is consistent. The `lintr` and `styler` packages can help make this easier:

-   `lintr`: You can use the 'Lint current file' command in the 'Addins' menu in R Studio to obtain a list of all the places your script doesn't comply with the style guide. You can then change your code to comply.

-   `styler`: The 'Style active file' command (also accessed through the Addins menu) or 'Ctrl+Shift+A' will do some of these changes for you. However, it is worth rerunning `lintr` afterwards to check any remaining issues.

There are a few instances when we vary from the `tidyverse` style guide for our own needs, which are laid out below:

1.  We explicitly call packages rather than loading them.

    Do:
    
    `dplyr::select(...)`

    Don't: 
    
    `library(dplyr)` 
    
    `select(...)`

2.  We use roxygen for function documentation, further details are on the [Comments and Documentation page](codingcomments.Rmd).
