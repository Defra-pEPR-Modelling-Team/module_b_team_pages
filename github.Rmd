# How to clone a repository

'Cloning' a repository means creating a copy on your local machine that so you can run and edit the code in it!

To clone a repository, follow these steps:

1. First we need to generate a 'personal access token'. 
    a. To do this go to [Github's token generator page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and select ‘Generate new token’ then ‘Classic’.
    b. You can then put anything in note, but make sure the gist, repo, user and workflow boxes are checked and click generate token. 
    c. Make sure you copy and paste this token somewhere safe as you **won't be able to see it again**! We will need it later on and a lot in future
    - Unless you have set it not to, eventually this token will expire will expire and you will need to create a new one.

2.  Next obtain the address of the repository you want to clone. This can be found on the repository page on github by clicking the green "<> Code" button (it is usually the URL of the repo with ".git" at the end).

3. Next, in R Studio go to *‘File > New Project > Version Control > Git’* and paste in the address from the previous step. Then click 'Create project'.

4. You have now succesfully cloned a repo into your R Studio. You should now be able to access the git tab in the top right window.
    
# How to edit code

Once you have cloned a repo it is likely you will want to make some changes to the code in it. To do that follow these steps:

1. For QA purposes we do not edit the *main* or *dev* branches directly, so you will need to create a branch of your own. To do that in R Studio click the ‘New Branch’ button in the Git window.

2. You should then name your branch the same as the Jira ticket you are working on, for instance "B1-20 Extract and reformat RFI data". Then click 'Create'. The branch name next to the 'New Branch' button should now have the name of your branch.

3. Now is time for you to make your edits!
