    <input type="checkbox"> Have they updated the relevant quality assurance logs?
        
        - Add links to QA logs, Note there are also some sections that you (code reviewer) should fill out.
        
    <input type="checkbox"> Are any inputs they use documented in the data log?

-   Purpose
