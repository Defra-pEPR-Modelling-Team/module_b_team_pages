title: "How We Work"
---

When working on model the we use the following methodology:

| | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Meeting** | Allocating Tickets (11 am, 1 hour) | | Updates (10 am, 30 mins) | | Sprint Review (3:30 pm, 30 mins) |
| **Purpose** | Deciding which tickets we want to complete this week. Allocating amongst us. | Progressing tickets. | Updating on completed tickets, identifying blockers for uncompleted tickets. | Completing tickets. Making pull requests. | Reviewing completed tickets. Demonstrating working code and a look forward to next week. |

Several of these sprints will form each **model building cycle**. These will be bookended by extended kickoff and review meetings as shown below:

||||||||
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Activity** | Kickoff Meeting (1 hr) | Sprint 1 | Sprint 2 | Sprint 3 | ... | Review Meeting (1 hr) |
| **Purpose** | What do we want to achieve this cycle? ||||| Did we achieve our goals? What lessons did we learn? Review our ticket backlog. |

We manage tasks for each sprint on the [Module B1 Jira board](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/B1/boards/1483).
