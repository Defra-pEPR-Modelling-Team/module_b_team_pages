When working in sprint mode the planned cadence is:

| | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Week 1 | Sprint Planning (1hr) | | Task Meeting (15 mins) | | Task Meeting (15 mins) |
| Week 2 | Weekend Catch Up (15 mins) | | Task Meeting (15 mins) | | Sprint Review (1hr) |

Three or four of these two weeks sprint will form each **model building cycle**. We will use Jira and/or Github Projects to keep track of tasks.
