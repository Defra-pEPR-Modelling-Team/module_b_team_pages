When working on model the we use the following methodology:

| **Purpose** | Deciding which tickets we want to complete this week and allocating among us. | Updates, solving problems. | Updates, solving problems. | Helping with any tickets that have not been submitted for review. | Reviewing completed tickets. Demonstrating working code and a look forward to next week. |

Several of these sprints will form each **model building cycle**. These will be bookended by extended kickoff and review meetings as shown below:
