## Comments

Well written, well structured code should be able to be understood with minimal comments.

Comments should only be used to indicate coding choices that are not obvious or have multiple possible options.

## Function Documentation

We document our functions using [roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html).

**We should include at a minimum the @description, @param and @return tags.**

@examples and @seealso can also be useful.

**Any tags should be explicitly specified**, including @description and @title if used.

You can get an automatic roxygen skeleton for a function in R Studio through 'Code \> Insert Roxygen Skeleton' or by pressing *Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R*.

Below is an example of a well documented function:

# Repository Documentation

Every repository should have a README...
