## Linting Code

Currently we are using the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) which you can use through the `lintr` and `styler` packages:
    - `lintr`: You can use the 'Lint current file' command in the 'Addins' menu in R Studio to obtain a list of all the places your script doesn't comply with the style guide. You can then change your code to comply.
    - `styler`: The 'Style active file' command (also accessed through the Addins menu) or 'Ctrl+Shift+A' will do some of these changes for you. However, it is worth rerunning `lintr` afterwards to check any remaining issues. Additionally, the `styler::style_dir()` command will style all files in a given directory, speeding up the process somewhat. Note: before you use `styler` you will need to tell it which style guide to use through 'Addins > Set style > styler::tidyverse_style()'.
    
We run `lintr` automatically when you commit through the use of [commit hooks](https://www.google.com/search?q=wha+tare+commit+hooks&safe=active&sca_esv=573154237&sxsrf=AM9HkKkwVTiv4E_4QYR5aZSJRG3wVKhkJw%3A1697192837676&ei=hRspZZ_wKOO28gLsu5j4AQ&ved=0ahUKEwjfxtGB6PKBAxVjm1wKHewdBh8Q4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=wha+tare+commit+hooks&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFXdoYSB0YXJlIGNvbW1pdCBob29rczIHEAAYDRiABDIIEAAYCBgeGA0yCBAAGIoFGIYDMggQABiKBRiGA0idFVDsCFjqE3ADeAGQAQKYAdEBoAHXCKoBBTQuNC4xuAEDyAEA-AEBwgIKEAAYRxjWBBiwA8ICBxAjGLACGCfCAgYQABgHGB7CAggQABgIGAcYHsICChAhGKABGMMEGAriAwQYACBBiAYBkAYI&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:2ebd25be,vid:d70a8PXbrb8,st:0) 
This is achieved throigh the [precommit](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/index.html) package which will also soon automate our unit tests. 

We may also adapt the `tidyverse` style guide for our own needs, as we have started to do below, but this should be automatic through `lintr` and `styler`.

## Coding Standards

In addition to the `tidyverse` style guide you should adopt the following practices:

1. We explicitly call packages rather than loading them.

<table>
<tr>
<th> &emsp; </th>
<th> Do </th>
<th> &emsp; </th>
<th> Don't </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
```{r, eval=FALSE}

dplyr::select(...)

```
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

select(...)

```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

2. Packages should only be those available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
3. Generally we should be using the pipe operator (`%>%`) and tidyverse packages rather than loops. This means we need to load the `magrittr` package.
4. Variable names must make sense in plain English e.g. `local_authority_population` not `lapop`.
6. We should modularise our code as much as possible, i.e. discrete parts of the code that do a particular job should be contained in a function. The end goal is to have the whole model run from one main file that calls functions.

We have a PowerPoint with further information on our [coding standards](https://defra.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/Team1478/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B98C3D254-86E8-44FD-BB2E-206B37F6F802%7D&file=Coding%20Standards.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true).

## Naming Conventions

1. Github repositories and R scripts should be all lower case with underscores "_" instead of spaces (e.g. *module_b*)
2. If a file contains a single function, give the file the same name as the function.
3. Functions should be named after the task that they perform (e.g. `calculate_average()`)
3. Input files should keep the name they are received with wherever possible to aid trace-ability.
4. Output files should be informatively named, with underscores "_" instead of spaces (e.g. *Wales_Disposal_Tonnages.csv*)

Where naming is unclear, follow these principles:
- Consistency, above all else
- Short but descriptive and human readable names
- No spaces, for machine readability - underscores (_) or dashes (-) are preferred
- Use of consistent date formatting (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD)
- Padding the left side of numbers with zeros to maintain order - e.g. 001 instead of 1. The number of zeros should reflect the expected number of files.

**- Do not let styling get in the way of progress, these are all simple changes that can be made retrospectively. **
