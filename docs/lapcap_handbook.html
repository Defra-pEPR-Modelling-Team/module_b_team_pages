<h3>Model Versioning</h3>
<p>We use a process of model versioning designed to allow easy
rolling-back to past versions.</p>
<p>In version Vx.y.z</p>
<ul>
<li>The first number, x, should be updated when figures are published
externally (including publishing letters, use in public base fees
etc.)</li>
<li>The second number, y, should be updated when figures are shared
non-publically (e.g. with Simpler Recycling, MHCLG, DESNZ etc.)</li>
<li>The third number, z, should be updated when there are changes to the
data inputs or the data pipeline (to allow rolling back to the correct
data in the future)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="model_tagging"><strong>How to update the tagged
version</strong></h4>
<p>When a new version of the model needs to be tagged on GitHub, follow
the below steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a branch from dev</li>
<li>Change the model_version parameter in <code>run_LAPCAP_model</code>
(in <code>main.R</code>) and the model_version parameter in the
data_pipeline function in <code>update_data_pipeline.R</code>. Commit
and push these changes to your branch</li>
<li>Run the data pipeline with the new model_version parameter to create
a folder on the aws bucket containing all the data for that version of
the model (remembering to restart your R session and clean your
environment before running the pipeline) - see <a
href="#how_to_data_input">here</a> for full data pipeline guidance</li>
<li>Ensure that the data pipeline and model both run correctly with the
new model_version parameter</li>
<li>Open a pull request (PR) to merge your branch back into dev</li>
<li>Merge the branch into dev (following any QA processes) and delete
the now-redundant branch</li>
<li>Tag the commit on dev with the new model version using GitHub’s
tagging feature</li>
<li>Optionally, if publishing externally and updating the first number
in the model version, you should now open a PR and merge dev into
main</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensure that the rest of the team are aware of the version being
tagged so they can rebase their branches if necessary.</p>

<h1>Coding Process Detail</h1>
<div id="decide-to-change-code" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Decide to change code</h2>
<p>The modelling team, led by G7s, will identify the most important
changes needed ahead of the next release of modelling outputs.</p>
<p>They may choose to make use of the Analytical Board, TWG or Sounding
Board in determining this.</p>
<p>They may also choose to seek signoff of their plans from the model
owner or project board, or to simply make them aware, to ensure planned
changes are expected.</p>
<p>An agile methodology using Jira is then used to plan out the delivery
of these changes. Time for quality assurance should
<strong>ALWAYS</strong> be built into each ticket in this planning, it
should be understood that if there is not time for quality assurance
then there is not time for the work.</p>
</div>
<div id="make-changes-to-code" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Make changes to code</h2>
<p>Through R Studio and Github changes are made to the existing LAPCAP
model. This will be achieved through standard Git practice,
e.g. branching off from the dev branch. Instructions for how to do this
can be found in the <a href="new_induction_stuff.html">new starter
section</a>.</p>
<p>The changes required should be clearly laid out in the relevant Jira
ticket.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If the changes involve adding, removing or changing an assumption
then the modelling team member must update the relevant assumption
log:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="how_to_assumption">How to change an assumption</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Identify an assumption.</p>
<p>We define assumptions as <strong>“choices analysts make to correct
for low quality or absent data or information, that knowingly introduce
inaccuracy into our outputs.”</strong></p>
<p>Questions to help you determine whether a section of code is an
assumption could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you had to make a specific choice for how to model?</li>
<li>Is your choice a simplification of reality?</li>
<li>Theoretically were there other choices you could have made?</li>
<li>Would changing your choice affect the final number?</li>
<li>Is this information recorded elsewhere (e.g. in a data log or the
technical document)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Record your assumption in-code</p>
<p>Paste the following code snippet below the relevant portion of code
and edit to reflect the above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Assumption: Title of assumption
# Quality: RED
# Impact: AMBER
# Detailed description
# on one line or many.</code></pre>
<p>The title of the assumption should be short, clear and unique to this
assumption.</p>
<p>The RAG rating is a red, amber or green rating summarising both the
quality (e.g. how confident we are) and impact (e.g. how much model
outputs are likely to be affected) of the assumption.</p>
<p>The detail description should give all information needed for someone
to understand the assumption, including why an assumption is needed, why
you have made the choice and more.</p>
<p>For more info on the package behind our assumptions log go to: <a
href="https://assumptions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Assumptions
1.1.0 Docs</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Record your assumption in the relevant assumptions log</p>
<p>Each module has its own assumptions log which you can find via the
LAPCAP library.</p>
<p>You will need to fill out the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ID <em>- prefilled</em></p></li>
<li><p>Assumption title <em>- same as reported in code</em></p></li>
<li><p>Detailed description <em>- same as reported in code</em></p></li>
<li><p>Reporter <em>- your name</em></p></li>
<li><p>Script(s) <em>- which R script the assumption can be found
in</em></p></li>
<li><p>Line(s) in code <em>- which lines in the script are
relevant</em></p></li>
<li><p>RAG <em>- same as reported in code</em></p></li>
<li><p>RAG explanation <em>- an explanation for why you gave the above
RAG rating</em></p></li>
<li><p>Links to supporting evidence <em>- any supporting evidence that
you used in formulating this assumption, which should be stored in the
corresponding ‘Supporting Evidence’ folder</em></p></li>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If the changes involve updating a data import then the data pipeline
must be refreshed and data logs updated:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="how_to_data_input">How to modify the data pipeline</h3>
<p>We have separated the code that processes our data inputs from the
rest of the model,. this code is known as the <em>data pipeline</em>.The
data pipeline is our way of version controlling input data for LAPCAP,
meaning we can run previous versions of the model even if inputs have
changed.</p>
<p>It works by reading the raw data inputs from AWS S3, processing them
in R and then saving them back to AWS in a new version specific
location. The model can then read from this location.</p>
<p>Therefore if you need to change, add or remove a data input or the
way it is processed, you will need to edit the data pipeline. Guidance
for how to do this can be found below.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When working on or updating the data pipeline itself
(experimentation, testing, logic changes etc.) or updating/changing a
data source, <strong>you <em>must</em> ensure you have changed the
model_version parameter in any calls to the data_pipeline
function</strong> – this prevents you from accidentally overwriting data
being used by the “live” model and ensures rolling-back to versions is
easy in the future.</li>
<li>The pipeline will tell you if you are going to overwrite any
data.</li>
<li>You should use a unique string for your model_version parameter
e.g. “your_name_test”.</li>
<li>Once you have finished your experimentation/changes make sure to
update the model_version parameter to the correct model version number
before merging back into dev, and delete any temporary folders you
created in aws using your model_version parameter. Follow the <a
href="#model_tagging">Model Versioning guidance</a> to update the model
version and run the pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="running-the-data-pipeline"><strong>Running the Data
Pipeline:</strong></h4>
<p>To run the data pipeline, run the <code>update_data_pipeline.R</code>
script. This will update to the latest version of the LAPCAP package,
load all of the pipeline scripts, and run the pipeline (including saving
the outputs to the aws bucket). This will create a new folder of
processed data at “Module_B1/Inputs/Processed/” named after the
model_version parameter.</p>
<p>There are dependencies between the sub-pipelines (e.g. waste flow
using data from scheme data), so they will need to be run in order in
any experimentation.</p>
<p>If you are running pipeline functions outside of the pipeline itself,
you will likely need to define the following variables:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>s3_bucket &lt;- &quot;s3-ranch-043&quot;
root_folder &lt;- &quot;Module_B1/Inputs&quot;
file_log &lt;- list()</code></pre>

are not confident with what you have written then get someone to check.
Before any numbers are publicised all updates to the technical document
should be checked. When the word document has been fully approved, only
then should the markdown file be changed. (This is for your ease of use
as it is much easier to edit a word document).</p>
<p><strong>How to know if you should update the technical
document</strong></p>
<p>If the changes to the model you have created have changed the
functionality of the model then you should update the relevent section
of the technical document. The sections of the technical document mirror
the model modules. Furthermore, if a new calculation is added, then the
example calculations section should also be updated. Whenever a new file
in the model (not the pipeline) is created, the technical document
should also be created. Even if there is no actual changes to model
functionality, the related content section for the relevant module
should also be updated with the name of the new file created. This is
because when the markdown is created it checks that all files have been
covered in the technical document.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for wrtiting the technical document/example
calculations:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Ensure you explain the model in terms that a non-technical person
can understand</p></li>
<li><p>Use as many diagrams as possible to aid understanding</p></li>
<li><p>Use example calculations/equations</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use any language like “I” or “we”</p></li>
<li><p>If you are not sure how to write your section then read some
other sections for guidance or ask someone to help.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are updating the example calculations section there should
be no surprises! Each variable you mention should have previously
mentioned or you need to say where it has come from.</p></li>
<li><p>All equations in example calculations should follow
through.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What happens with the technical document when we publish
numbers?</strong></p>
<p>The final technical document should be created using markdown,
however, before any changes are made to the markdown, the following must
happen:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All new files that have been covered in the updated technical
document should be added to the related contents section in the markdown
code.</p></li>
<li><p>You should run the generate technical document function to check
which files are not covered in the technical document. If it is fine for
these files to not be covered, fine, but if they include important
functionality then update the technical document.</p></li>
<li><p>The technical document should be sent to relevant parties who
want to check it. This should include the FPC team, members of adjoining
teams, the G6 (Tristan), and any other people you think might want to
add input.</p></li>
<li><p>The HTML version of the example calculations section should be
sent to the contents team to check if there are any significant changes.
This is subject to it still being included in the LA guidance and
published.</p></li>

<h3 id="how_to_unit_test">How to write a unit test</h3>
<p>Unit tests are automated checks that verify individual functions or
modules behave as expected. They act as a safety net when changing or
adding features, ensuring existing functionality remains unchanged. The
tests serve as live documentation for how functions are intended to work
but also pinpoint which part of the code does not work when failing.
This section explains how to write, run, and maintain unit tests for our
LAPCAP model. </p>
<p>Assuming you’ve set up the correct directory and project (module_b)
you can find all unit tests in the LAPCAP model in the
~/module_b/LAPCAP/tests folder. You should be able to click on any one
of them and run them as any normal function (Ctrl+Shift+Enter). After
which the test results will appear in the “Console” pane. You will see
messages like “Test passed” or error messages if something goes
wrong. </p>
<p>If you wish to run them all at the same time you can use:
“testthat::test_dir(”~/module_b/LAPCAP/tests”)” which will execute all
the files in that location. </p>
<h4 id="writing-a-unit-test">Writing a unit test</h4>
<p>Before writing or executing unit tests, it is crucial to ensure that
all functions required for testing are properly loaded. You can do this
by simply finding the function you’re seeking to make a unit test for
and all the functions that are relevant to it and running them before
starting the unit test. </p>
<p>Sourcing each function individually in every test script should be
avoided (as names/location of functions may change). To avoid not having
the right function you should load all the functions at once into your
environment.  One effective method to do this is by loading LAPCAP as a
package, using library(LAPCAP), which makes all functions available in
your environment. Alternatively, you can use
devtools::load_all(“~/module_b/LAPCAP”) to load all the  functions into
your R session. As a manual way to load the functions that are in this
particular folder. If the folder or functions change location or name
than you can modify the code accordingly.</p>
<p>Unit tests generally fall into three categories.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal operation tests</strong>, verify the core
functionality of the code using typical inputs. <strong>Most of our
tests should be like this.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Error fixing tests</strong>, confirm that known problematic
inputs (e.g., NAs, zeros, negatives, mismatched names) are correctly
handled or “fixed.”</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Error catching tests</strong>, ensure that inappropriate
inputs trigger proper error messages and stop execution as
intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the testthat package in R to write and organise our unit
tests. Testthat offers a straightforward syntax for creating tests and
assertions, making it simple to check whether function outputs match
expected results.  </p>
<p>It provides functions like expect_equal, expect_identical, and
expect_error that allow you to compare actual and expected outcomes,
check data types, and confirm that proper errors are raised under
invalid inputs. </p>
<p>Make sure that testthat is installed and loaded in your testing
environment before running your tests. Furthermore, it is important to
name your test files clearly (e.g., test_inflate_costs.R,
test_align_facility.R) so that it is immediately obvious which module or
function each test is verifying.</p>

<h2>3. Verify the changes</h2>
<p>Once assigned a review the team member must complete the full
checklist provided by the principle analyst. It is also the QAers must
also review the list critically and ensure that it is both appropriate
and sufficient. If the QAer feels otherwise they must raise this with in
the first instance the principle analyst and then failing this the model
owner.</p>
<p>You should use the checklist below, which is also included in the
pull request template, to ensure you carry out all necessary checks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🌛 <strong>Checker QA checklist</strong></p>
<p>Before approving a pull request the reviewer <strong>must</strong>
have completed the below checks: In addition to the above, the following
is a checklist for the reviewer to use:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><p><label><input type="checkbox" />The “do-er” checklist has been
completed to an appropriate standard, fields above the checklist have
been appropriately completed</label></p></li>
<li><p><label><input type="checkbox" />Code meets the requirements set

performed and the outcomes</label></p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also you should carry out any additional checks required, which have
been added to the Checker Checklist by the doer.</p>
<p>Reviewers should trace the full logic of the code, both by reading
through it and by running it and spot-checking intermediate data frames.
They should inspect any relevant data imports both in R Studio and
directly from their original source. They should examine model outputs
before and after the changes to ensure they make sense. They should make
sure they are able to replicate any processes or calculations in the
code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional checks</strong></p>
<p>The below is a list of QA checks that reviewers may want to perform
in addition to the above. Note that this lists is <strong>not
exhaustive</strong> and it is the responsibility of the principle
analyst (do-er) and the QAer (checker) to ensure all items that need to
be checked have been:</p>
<p>1. Check that the calculations done are fit for purpose and are
correct</p>
<p>2. Check that uncertainty has been considered and appropriately
accounted for (e.g. has sensitivity analysis been performed)</p>
<p>3. Check that the data used is fit for purpose and the best option
available to us</p>
<p>4. Check that other appropriate documentation has been completed or
updated to an appropriate standard e.g. the technical document</p>
<p>5. Is the data being correctly pulled into the model?</p>
<p>6. Is the data being properly cleaned and manipulated (either before
the model or during the code)?</p>
<p>7. Has the data been verified and validated? Has it been checked for
potential errors? And has it been confirmed that the data appropriate to
use in the first place? Is it the best possible option?</p>
<p>8. Are there other results other than the outputs of the last model
that the results need to be compared to?</p>
<p>9. In cases where new data is added, or a change is heavily dependent
upon a particular data source, does the model respond as expected to
extreme values, negatives, zeroes, NAs etc? Is it possible to break the
model with the data or generate impossible results?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reviewers should leave comments via GitHub, to ensure a record of
verification and validation. GitHub has several features to help with
this such as filtering changes by commit or file type, marking scripts
as viewed, making direct code suggestions and bundling many comments
into one review.</p>
<p>These reviews may go through one or more cycles of requesting
changes, in order for the reviewer to be happy. GitHub has functionality
to enable this.</p>
<p>The following explains the practical steps followed in when reviewing
code:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="how_to_code_review">How to do a code review</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSnbOtw4izI">Github
code review tutorial</a> shows you how to review a pull request, or you
can follow the steps below.</p>
<p>Follow these step-by-step instructions to do a proper code
review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Navigate to the ‘<em>pull request</em>’ that has been assigned to
you. Read the description provided and use the checklist to aid your
review.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the ‘<em>Files changed</em>’ tab to see the changes
made, here you can make comments and suggestions as you see fit by
clicking the blue plus to the left of the line you want to comment
on.</p>
<p><img src="assets/add_comment_button.png" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Make sure to tick ‘<em>Start a review</em>’ rather than ‘<em>Add
single comment</em>’.</li>
<li>Github has lots of functionality to make this process easier,
including being able to mark scripts as ‘<em>Viewed</em>’ and limiting
changes to certain commits.</li>
<li>You should also run the code in R Studio and check the relevant QA
log has been updated.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>When you are ready click ‘<em>Finish your review</em>’ add a
summary comment and then click ‘<em>Submit review</em>’. You may choose
to leave comments to be responded to, suggest changes to be made or
simply approve the pull request straight away.</p>
<p><img src="assets/finish_review.png" width="311"
height="222" /></p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The QAer should then write a summary of the checks performed. In
particular noting issues and any unusual checks that have had to be
performed in the process of QAing.</p>
</div>
<div id="merge-changes-into-dev-branch" class="section level2">
<h2>4. Merge changes into dev branch</h2>
<p>Once approved, changes should be merged into the dev branch. This may
require resolving merge conflicts.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="how-to-merge">How to merge</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Once your reviewer has inspected your code they may ask you some
questions or suggest some changes. Once you have responded to these they
will approve your pull request and you can merge your changes! This will
look like:</p>
<p><img src="assets/passed_pr_check.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if any of the QA checklist items have been
left unchecked, GitHub will automatically block merging. It will look
like:</p>
<p><img src="assets/failed_pr_check.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>You will need to check there are no ‘merge conflicts’. This is
where someone has changed the same files as you and so you need to agree
with that person what are the correct changes and modify accordingly,
Github will read ‘<em>Able to merge</em>’ indicating there are no
conflicts.</p>
<p><img src="assets/ready_to_merge.png" /></p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally the QA analyst (or the appropriate G7) will review the pull
requests on a weekly basis to ensure that they been done to a high
standard.and record them in the verification log <a
href="https://defra.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/Team1478/Extended%20Producer%20Responsibility%20for%20Packaging/07%20Fees%20and%20Payments%20Calculator/18%20Module%20B1%20-%20LA%20FNCs/04%20Bottom-up%20Modelling/00%20Model%20Master/03%20LAPCAP%20Signoff%20Log.xlsm?d=w5065d9665d34493c92e1fca1ce67b2fd&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=3xjNJt">03
