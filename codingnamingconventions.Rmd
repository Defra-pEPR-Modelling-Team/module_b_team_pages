## Github Repositories

-   Repositories should contain all code needed, in other words you should not need to run code from two different repositories to achieve your aim.

-   Repository names should be a short description of this aim.

-   Repository names should be all lower case with underscores "\_" instead of spaces (aka **snake_case**).

*For example*: `gate_fees_analysis`

## R Scripts

-   Generally scripts should have the same name as the single function they contain.

-   In rare cases of multiple functions in a script, a summary name that relates all functions in the script should be used.

*For example*: Script contains only the `tidy_q100()` function: `tidy_q100.R`.

Script contains `import_inflation_data()`, `import_LA_names()` and `import_ONS_data`: `imports.R`.

## Functions

-   Function names should also be snake_case.

-   Function names should reflect their purpose and should use one of the following verbs followed by the data object or objects that the action is performed on.

    -   `import`

    -   `clean`

    -   `extract`

    -   `calculate`

    -   `join`?

    -   `apportion`?

    -   `sum`?

    -   `export`

ADD DEFINTIONS FOR EACH?

## Unit Tests

-   Unit test names should include

## Input Files

-   Input files should keep the name they are received with wherever possible to aid trace-ability.

## Object Names?

## Column Names?

## Output Files

-   Output files should

-   Outputs should be dated to aid trace-ability.

## Other

Where naming is unclear, follow these principles:

-   Use `snake_case` - Maintain consistency above all else

-   Short but descriptive and human readable names

-   No spaces, for machine readability, underscores (\_) or dashes (-) are preferred

-   Use of consistent date formatting (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD)

-   Padding the left side of numbers with zeros to maintain order - e.g. 001 instead of 1. The number of zeros should reflect the expected number of files.
