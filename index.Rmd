title: "FPC Coding Guidance"

We currently use Defra's **Scientific Coding Environment (SCE)** which allows us to write and run code on *Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2 virtual machines*, and store our data using *Amazon Web Services S3*. Speak to the **SCE admins** (Jake as of May 2024) if you are not set up on the SCE.

These pages contain all the information you need to write **good code** in the Fees and Payments Calculator team! You should refer back to them if there is something you don't know *(but feel free to ask questions)*!

Please suggest anything you think is missing from this site!
