title: "How to Create a New Repository"
---

* Use the [template repository](https://github.com/Defra-pEPR-Modelling-Team/TemplateRepo).
  * Use this template > Create a new repository
* Repository names should be all lower case with underscores _ between words.
* A *.gitignore* file should be used to stop any sensitive data being stored on github.
* Make sure to update the repo description and *README* file.
* We use the *main* branch for fully QA'd production ready code, and the *dev* branch for checked code that is still being developed.
* By default the *main* and *dev* branch should be protected meaning, before merging, changes will require a pull request and at least 1 approval.
* All files for a project (i.e. any that may need to talk to each other) should be in one repository.
